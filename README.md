# CensusBlockQueryTool
A tool for finding the Census Block code from a given latitude/longatude pair

A friend of mine needed to use the FCC Census Block Conversion API to determine the FIPS codes for hundreds of latitute/longitude pairs. Rather than manually enter the information through the browser, I built this tool to automate the process.

This version has hard coded values for demo purposes; it can be easily adated to use an input file of lat/long value pairs. It outputs the resulting FIPS codes to a text file for further review.
